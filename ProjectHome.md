OOPar is an object oriented framework conceived for object oriented parallelization of scientific code. The toolkit defines its own communication protocol which is implemented on top of any available open source communication library (MPI, PVM and so on). The OOPar kernel is comprised of six base classes which provides the necessary functionalities for the establishment of a parallel environment. Three management specific classes, namely OOPDataManager, OOPTaskManager and OOPCommManager which are managers of data, tasks and communication respectively. The remaining three classes defines two abstract entities on the environment, OOPTask, OOPData and a non abstract class OOPMetaData. OOPTask and OOPData implements abstract task and abstract data respectively and are base classes for any of those entities subjected to parallelization. OOPMetaData implements some sort of header on the protocol avoiding overloading the OOPData data structures.
